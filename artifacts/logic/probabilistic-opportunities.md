# Probabilistic & Mathematical Enhancements

## 1. Adaptive Animation Quality via Multi-Armed Bandits
- **Context:** The `Home` page features resource-intensive cosmic animations. Rendering them at full fidelity on low-powered devices increases bounce rate.
- **Approach:** Implement a **Thompson Sampling multi-armed bandit** selecting among animation profiles (`high`, `medium`, `low`). Reward is derived from client-side metrics: session duration and interaction counts.
- **Outcome:** Minimizes regret by converging on the fidelity that balances immersion and performance, targeting a 15% reduction in bounce rate on mobile.

## 2. Personalized Content Recommendations with Bayesian Updating
- **Context:** The `About` and `Contact` pages include narrative content modules. Currently static, they could react to visitor engagement.
- **Approach:** Track clicks and scroll depth per module, modeling engagement probability with a **Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian update**. Rank modules per visitor segment (e.g., returning vs. new) and reorder content accordingly.
- **Outcome:** Expected to increase CTA interactions by 10% by continuously updating the posterior belief of what content resonates.

## 3. Caching Strategy Using HyperLogLog for Unique Visitor Counts
- **Context:** Observability requires unique visitor metrics without storing raw user IDs.
- **Approach:** Use a **HyperLogLog** sketch maintained client-side (with local storage) and aggregated server-side via serverless endpoint to estimate unique user counts per timeframe.
- **Outcome:** Provides privacy-preserving cardinality estimates with <2% error, enabling scaling decisions and anomaly detection for traffic spikes.
