# ADR-001: Adopt Senior Developer Modernization Framework

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2024-05-16
- **Deciders:** Frontend Tech Leads, Platform Engineering, Security Guild
- **Consulted:** Product Management, Design Systems Team

## Context
The Laura React application has grown without formal governance around delivery, security, or observability. Existing processes rely on manual testing and ad-hoc deployments to Railway. As we plan major feature expansions and increased traffic, we require a modernization initiative aligned with industry best practices.

## Decision
Adopt the Senior Developer Modernization Framework as the guiding set of principles for architecture, security, logic enhancements, and governance. The framework mandates:
- Comprehensive CI/CD automation with quality gates and artifact management.
- DevSecOps practices including branch protection, code ownership, and secret management.
- Introduction of probabilistic methods to improve personalization and performance.
- Institutionalization of governance through ADRs, DORA metrics tracking, and living documentation.

## Consequences
- **Positive:**
  - Predictable releases and faster recovery via automated pipelines and observability.
  - Reduced security risk with shift-left tooling, CODEOWNERS, and Vault-managed secrets.
  - Increased product differentiation through data-driven personalization features.
  - Shared understanding of architectural choices via ADR catalog and documentation.
- **Negative:**
  - Initial investment in tooling, training, and configuration.
  - Requires continuous maintenance of telemetry stack and security tooling.
  - Higher review overhead until teams adapt to new processes.

## Follow-Up Actions
1. Implement the CI/CD workflow defined in `artifacts/ci-cd/github-actions.yml`.
2. Configure branch protection and CODEOWNERS per security artifacts.
3. Schedule quarterly reviews of modernization progress and update ADR status.
