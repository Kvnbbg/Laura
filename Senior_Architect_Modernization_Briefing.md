# Senior Architect's Modernization Briefing

## 1. Current State Assessment (State Vector Analysis)

### Architectural & Operational Baseline
- Vite + React 18 application with TypeScript and SCSS, delivering Home/About/Contact experiences and scripts for build/test/lint/serve operations.【F:package.json†L1-L39】
- Railway deployment configuration present with `npm run serve` entry point but no automated promotion pipeline; deployments are likely manual.【F:railway.toml†L1-L13】【F:package.json†L7-L14】
- No existing CI/CD workflows, CODEOWNERS, or branch protection codified in the repository root.

### Gaps vs. Modernization Doctrine
| Doctrine Pillar | Observed Gap | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Comprehensive CI/CD | No workflow automating lint/test/build/security scanning. | Manual regressions, inconsistent artifact management. |
| Observability | No telemetry configuration or logging strategy beyond default console logs. | Limited insight into performance issues or release health. |
| Dependency Management | `npm audit` not enforced; Renovate/Dependabot absent. | Elevated supply-chain risk. |
| Supply Chain Security | Secrets (`RAILWAY_API_TOKEN`) implied but unmanaged; no CODEOWNERS or branch protections. | Risk of leaked credentials and unreviewed merges. |
| Threat Modeling | No structured threat model for SPA or Railway edge. | Unknown attack surface coverage. |
| Probabilistic Enhancements | UX logic fully deterministic (static modules, fixed animation fidelity). | Missed opportunities for adaptive personalization. |
| Governance | No ADRs or DORA tracking processes documented. | Architectural decisions implicit, limited visibility into delivery performance. |

## 2. Modernization Roadmap (Quantum Superposition ➜ Ground State)

### Phase A – Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Adopt CI/CD pipeline** using `artifacts/ci-cd/github-actions.yml` to enforce lint, test, build, SAST, and artifact publishing.【F:artifacts/ci-cd/github-actions.yml†L1-L129】
2. **Establish observability guardrails** following `artifacts/ci-cd/observability-strategy.md` with OpenTelemetry instrumentation, Web Vitals metrics, and Grafana dashboards.【F:artifacts/ci-cd/observability-strategy.md†L1-L49】
3. **Enable dependency hygiene** via Dependabot/ Renovate and weekly scheduled security scans defined in the workflow.【F:artifacts/ci-cd/github-actions.yml†L5-L12】

### Phase B – Security Ground State (Weeks 3-4)
4. **Enforce branch protections & code ownership** using `artifacts/security/CODEOWNERS` and `artifacts/security/branch-protection-rules.md`; enable signed commits and dependency review.【F:artifacts/security/CODEOWNERS†L1-L17】【F:artifacts/security/branch-protection-rules.md†L1-L23】
5. **Centralize secrets** with HashiCorp Vault per `artifacts/security/secrets-management-plan.md`, integrating GitHub OIDC and scheduled rotation.【F:artifacts/security/secrets-management-plan.md†L1-L39】
6. **Run STRIDE-lite threat modeling workshops** focusing on Railway deployment, SPA runtime, and telemetry ingestion (document outcomes in future ADRs).

### Phase C – Intelligent Experiences (Weeks 5-7)
7. **Prototype probabilistic UX improvements** outlined in `artifacts/logic/probabilistic-opportunities.md` (bandit-driven animation fidelity, Bayesian content ranking, HyperLogLog traffic estimation).【F:artifacts/logic/probabilistic-opportunities.md†L1-L19】
8. **Instrument experiments** by capturing reward signals in telemetry stack and gating rollouts behind feature flags (e.g., LaunchDarkly or open-source alternatives).

### Phase D – Governance & Continuous Improvement (Weeks 8+) 
9. **Ratify ADR-001** and establish ADR cadence for future architecture/security decisions.【F:artifacts/governance/ADR-001-adopt-modernization-framework.md†L1-L33】
10. **Automate DORA metrics** following `artifacts/governance/dora-metrics-plan.md` and surface trends in leadership reviews.【F:artifacts/governance/dora-metrics-plan.md†L1-L27】
11. **Institutionalize living documentation** by expanding README/GETTING_STARTED with observability runbooks and linking ADR catalogue.

## 3. Artifacts Directory (Phase 2 Deliverables)

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `artifacts/ci-cd/github-actions.yml` | GitHub Actions pipeline with lint/test/build, CodeQL, npm audit, preview + production deploy stages.【F:artifacts/ci-cd/github-actions.yml†L1-L129】 |
| `artifacts/ci-cd/observability-strategy.md` | Logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting blueprint leveraging OpenTelemetry and Grafana.【F:artifacts/ci-cd/observability-strategy.md†L1-L49】 |
| `artifacts/security/CODEOWNERS` | Default reviewers and ownership boundaries for critical paths.【F:artifacts/security/CODEOWNERS†L1-L17】 |
| `artifacts/security/branch-protection-rules.md` | Enforcement requirements for protected branches, reviews, and signed commits.【F:artifacts/security/branch-protection-rules.md†L1-L23】 |
| `artifacts/security/secrets-management-plan.md` | HashiCorp Vault adoption plan, policies, automation, and rotation guidelines.【F:artifacts/security/secrets-management-plan.md†L1-L39】 |
| `artifacts/logic/probabilistic-opportunities.md` | Top three probabilistic enhancements (bandits, Bayesian updates, HyperLogLog).【F:artifacts/logic/probabilistic-opportunities.md†L1-L19】 |
| `artifacts/governance/ADR-001-adopt-modernization-framework.md` | Foundational ADR documenting adoption of modernization doctrine.【F:artifacts/governance/ADR-001-adopt-modernization-framework.md†L1-L33】 |
| `artifacts/governance/dora-metrics-plan.md` | Plan to calculate and review DORA metrics using GitHub, Railway, and PagerDuty data.【F:artifacts/governance/dora-metrics-plan.md†L1-L27】 |

## Next Steps
- Secure leadership approval for the roadmap and assign accountable owners per workstream.
- Kick off CI/CD implementation sprint; measure baseline DORA metrics pre-modernization.
- Schedule monthly modernization reviews to adjust backlog and capture new ADRs.
